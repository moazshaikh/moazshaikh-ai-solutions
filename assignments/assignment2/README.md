# University Department Class Definition 

## Objective
In this assignment we are to write a Python program to define a class to model some characteristics of a
university Department. Specifically, the class will track students requesting to major in that particular
department. Students will be represented by student objects created using the Student class developed in A2,
but with a ‘setMajor()’ method added that allows the Student object’s major to be reset. When an attempt is
made to add the student to a department’s major (program), the Department class will examine the Student
object data and decide whether to add them to the major. If not, the class returns a response indicating rejection
with a short reason why.

## Steps
- Department class is constructed to model characteristics of a university department.
- Department class is a container class. Student class is utilized to incorporate multiclass modeling architecture. 
- Department class will examine the Student object data and decide whether to add them to the major or not.
